librastro.so INSTALL file
=========================

We recommend compile librastro in an out-of-source fashion. Install
a recent version of cmake and follow these instructions:

(while in the root directory of the library)
$ mkdir build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/tmp/local ..
$ make
$ make install

You may also use ccmake (or any other graphical interface to cmake
configuration) to customize your installation. Librastro is equipped
to trace sequential of threaded applications (using __thread support
from modern compilers).
