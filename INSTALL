librastro.so INSTALL file
=========================

We recommend compile librastro in an out-of-source fashion. Install
a recent version of cmake and follow these instructions:

(while in the root directory of the library)
$ mkdir build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/tmp/local ..
$ make
$ make install

You may also use ccmake (or any other graphical interface to cmake
configuration) to customize your installation. The rastro's THREADED
option should only be activated if you need to trace an application
that uses pthreads.
